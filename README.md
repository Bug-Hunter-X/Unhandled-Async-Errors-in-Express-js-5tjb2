This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: unhandled errors within asynchronous operations.  The `bug.js` file showcases an asynchronous function (`someAsyncOperation`) that lacks proper error handling.  When this function throws an error, the Express.js application crashes without providing any informative error messages. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution by properly handling potential errors using a `catch` block, preventing the application from crashing.
